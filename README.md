# Calculator Program

This program is a simple calculator implemented in Python. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic calculations and save the equations to a text file. Additionally, users can choose to read the equations from a file and view them.

## Features

- Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations
- Defensive programming to handle errors such as zero division and invalid input
- Save equations to a text file
- Read equations from a file
- Interactive user interface with choice-based options

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

## Usage

1. Run the program by executing the following command:

2. The program will display a menu with two options:
- Enter 'continue' to perform a calculation and save the equation.
- Enter 'read' to read the equations from a file.

3. If you choose to perform a calculation:
- Enter the first number, second number, and the operator.
- The program will display the result of the calculation and save the equation to a text file named 'equations.txt'.
- You can choose to continue calculating or switch to reading equations.

4. If you choose to read equations:
- Enter the name of the file containing the equations.
- The program will display the equations stored in the file.
- You can then choose to save the equations to a new file or return to the calculation mode.

## File Structure

- `calculator.py`: The main Python script that implements the calculator program.
- `equations.txt`: The text file where the equations are saved.
